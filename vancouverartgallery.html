        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project was done as a part of IAT 333, Interaction Design Methods. The course focuses on examining concepts of design methods while teams work with participatory groups to research potential design focuses of the organizations.  We worked with Vancouver Art Gallery in order discover design opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Initial Research</h3>
        <p>Our first step after reaching an agreement with Vancouver Art Gallery was to research in depth about potential problems or opportunities of the gallery. 
          For our data collection, we conducted interviews outside the Vancouver Art Gallery with visitors exiting the gallery. We asked general questions on their motivations for visiting the gallery, how often they visited, and different ways they accessed information about the current exhibitions. We did 15 interviews which were about 5-minutes long to gather initial insight into our possible design focus.

        <h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
        <p>From our data, we analyzed common themes and problems we could work with.
          The application is relatively unknown to visitors of the Vancouver Art Gallery.
          Majority of the interviewees visited the Vancouver Art Gallery without a specific exhibition or event in mind. We could look into ways of boosting awareness of new and current exhibitions.
          Majority of the interviewees thought information about the gallery was accessible through the Vancouver Art Gallery website.

        <h3>The Final Product</h3>
        <p>Throughout the design process, we worked closely with our team and with users to refine the UI design.  
          We tested different variations of the design to see which ones were most effective and user-friendly.
          Making adjustments to the design based on technical constraints and limitations.
          The process of designing a UI for the DLDK Festival app involved a combination of research, testing, and iteration. By focusing on user-centered design principles, we were able to create a UI that met the needs of festival attendees and effectively communicated the brand and style of the DLDK Festival.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The project was conducted in Spring 2020, but faced difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reaching and interviewing potential attendees of the DLDK event proved challenging, as social gathering restrictions and travel limitations hindered communication. Contacting the event organizers was also difficult due to changes in plans and communication channels.
          Despite these obstacles, our team adapted by using online surveys and the website to collect data.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          One key takeaway from this project was the importance of involving users in the design process. By gathering feedback from users and testing different design variations, we were able to gain insights into the festival goers preferences and expectations. This helped us make informed decisions and create a UI that catered to their needs, ultimately leading to a more user-friendly and intuitive design.
