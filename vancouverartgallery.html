        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project was done as a part of IAT 333, Interaction Design Methods. The course focuses on examining concepts of design methods while teams work with participatory groups to research potential design focuses of the organizations.  We worked with Vancouver Art Gallery in order discover design opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Initial Research</h3>
        <p>Our first step after reaching an agreement with Vancouver Art Gallery was to research in depth about potential problems or opportunities of the gallery. 
          For our data collection, we conducted interviews outside the Vancouver Art Gallery with visitors exiting the gallery. We asked general questions on their motivations for visiting the gallery, how often they visited, and different ways they accessed information about the current exhibitions. We did 15 interviews which were about 5-minutes long to gather initial insight into our possible design focus.

        <h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
        <p>From our data, we analyzed common themes and problems we could work with.
          The application is relatively unknown to visitors of the Vancouver Art Gallery.
          Majority of the interviewees visited the Vancouver Art Gallery without a specific exhibition or event in mind. We could look into ways of boosting awareness of new and current exhibitions.
          Majority of the interviewees thought information about the gallery was accessible through the Vancouver Art Gallery website.

        <h3>Design Methods</h3>
        <p>After our analysis of our initial research, we set about creating a set of personas that best reflected the users we would design for.
          Along with our personas, we also utilized journey maps to get a full view and in depth thought process to a visitor’s experience.

        <h3>Concept Analysis</h3>
        <p>Through the design methods, our team identified important pain points during a user’s visit to the gallery.
          While we came up three design concepts to possibly resolve these pain points, we reframed our design focus after another round of user interviews and a zoom meeting with our stakeholders.
          We found that there was a disconnect with our initial design focus and the three concepts we created.
          Our new design focus ended up being: How can we create a sense of community and identity within the Vancouver Art Gallery that can be felt by regular and first-time visitors?

        <h3>Participatory Workshop</h3>
        <p>While we had our newly framed design focus, the main question, what exactly does a “sense of community” mean?
          We organized a participatory workshop with end-users and stakeholders of Vancouver Art Gallery to answer this question.
          We invited 5 participants between 20-30 split over 3 workshops. Workshops were conducted through Zoom and FigJam. Each workshop lasted around 45-60 minutes.
          Through this workshop we able to figure out two key points.
          There was a larger focus on establishing a sense of community through shared experiences and learning each other’s perspectives.
          To promote a sense of community, having a diverse and inclusive environment where people can engage is important

        <h3>Challenges and Reflection</h3>
        <p>The initial stages of the project was difficult due to our lack of experience working with a real organization outside of our circle. Our search for a participatory group ended up taking much longer and we were playing catch up. Thankfully, our team was able to pull through and work toward making a prototype to present to the Vancouver Art Gallery.
