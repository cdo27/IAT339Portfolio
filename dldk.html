        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>As a part of IAT 235, a course on Information Design, our team of 4 members set out to tackle possible opportunities and solution for the DLDK Festival.
          DLDK, also known as Don’t Let Daddy Know is one of the world’s leading EDM festivals.</p>

        <h3>Research and survey</h3>
        <p>We conducted research and interviews to better understand the needs and preferences of our target audience. In this case, the EDM Festival goers.
          We started by reviewing the DLDK Festival website and social media accounts to get a sense of the festival's brand and style.
          Afterwords, we conducted surveys and interviews with festival attendees to learn about their experience using the existing DLDK Festival website and what features they would like to see.

        <h3>Sketching and prototyping</h3>
        <p>After our research and interviews, we created wireframes and prototypes to test different design concepts. We started out by sketching out rough ideas for the app's layout and features.
          Using software such as InDesign and Figma to create more detailed wireframes and prototypes.
          Conducting usability tests with potential users to get feedback on the design and identify areas for improvement.

        <h3>The Final Product</h3>
        <p>Throughout the design process, we worked closely with our team and with users to refine the UI design.  
          We tested different variations of the design to see which ones were most effective and user-friendly.
          Making adjustments to the design based on technical constraints and limitations.
          The process of designing a UI for the DLDK Festival app involved a combination of research, testing, and iteration. By focusing on user-centered design principles, we were able to create a UI that met the needs of festival attendees and effectively communicated the brand and style of the DLDK Festival.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The project was conducted in Spring 2020, but faced difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reaching and interviewing potential attendees of the DLDK event proved challenging, as social gathering restrictions and travel limitations hindered communication. Contacting the event organizers was also difficult due to changes in plans and communication channels.
          Despite these obstacles, our team adapted by using online surveys and the website to collect data.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          One key takeaway from this project was the importance of involving users in the design process. By gathering feedback from users and testing different design variations, we were able to gain insights into the festival goers preferences and expectations. This helped us make informed decisions and create a UI that catered to their needs, ultimately leading to a more user-friendly and intuitive design.
